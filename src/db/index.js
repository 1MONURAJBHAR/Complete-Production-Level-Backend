/**process â†’ A global Node.js object that gives information and control over the current running Node.js process.
.exit(code) â†’ A method that ends the process with the given exit code.

Exit codes:
0 â†’ Success (no errors, everything went fine).
1 (or any non-zero value) â†’ Failure (something went wrong).
So:

process.exit(1);
ðŸ”¹ Immediately terminates the Node.js program.
ðŸ”¹ Returns exit code 1 to the operating system, signaling that the process ended with an error. */
