/**1. .countDocuments({ filter })

This is a Mongoose method, not an aggregation pipeline.
Example:

const totalVideos = await Video.countDocuments({ owner: channelId });


Here, { owner: channelId } is just a query filter, same as find().

It‚Äôs telling MongoDB: ‚ÄúCount how many documents in the videos collection have the field owner equal to this channelId.‚Äù
It does not use $match or pipeline stages, just a filter object.
Under the hood, MongoDB runs something like:
db.videos.countDocuments({ owner: ObjectId("...") }) */



  
  
  
  

  

  
  /**In MongoDB, when you create relationships, you usually store only the ID of the related document (not the whole document).

Example:

const commentSchema = new Schema({
  content: String,
  video: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Video" }, // reference
  owner: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }   // reference
});


Here:

video ‚Üí stores the _id of a Video document.
owner ‚Üí stores the _id of a User document.
By default, if you query a comment, you‚Äôll get only IDs:

{
  content: "Nice video!",
  video: "65123abc...",
  owner: "76123xyz..."
}

üîé What populate() does:

It replaces those IDs with the actual documents from the other collections.

Example:

const comment = await Comment.findOne().populate("owner").populate("video");


Now the result becomes:

{
  content: "Nice video!",
  video: {
    _id: "65123abc...",
    title: "My First Video",
    views: 200
  },
  owner: {
    _id: "76123xyz...",
    username: "JohnDoe",
    email: "john@example.com"
  }
}

‚úÖ Simple meaning:
populate() = join-like feature in MongoDB via Mongoose.
It fetches the related documents for you, instead of just showing their IDs. */

  

  


  

  

  
  
  
  
  
/**Step by step:
Video.find({ owner: channelId })
Finds all videos where owner matches channelId.

.distinct("_id")

From those videos, extract only the unique _id values.
Result: an array of video IDs belonging to that channel.

Example:

[ ObjectId("a1"), ObjectId("a2"), ObjectId("a3") ]


video: { $in: [...] }

//Ye video ki field(liked odcument me se) inn IDs(list of IDs which are on my channel) ki list me honi chahiye,agar hai toh us document ko collect kar lo. 
/***************************or************************ */
/*Means: ‚Äúvideo field must be one of these IDs.‚Äù, The matched video fields document is collected and then counted.
So this will match documents (like comments, likes, etc.) where video refers to any of that channel‚Äôs videos.

‚úÖ Example use case:
Suppose you‚Äôre querying Comment collection:

const comments = await Comment.find({
  video: { $in: await Video.find({ owner: channelId }).distinct("_id") }
});

This finds all comments across all videos of a given channel. 

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// 

//****************************************************In simple words********************************************* */
/*video: { $in: await Video.find({ owner: channelId }).distinct("_id") }
Imagine:
Video collection ‚Üí has many videos. Each video has an _id and an owner.

Comment collection ‚Üí each comment belongs to a video (via video field).

Step by step:
Video.find({ owner: channelId }) ‚Üí Find all videos of that channel.
üëâ Example result:


Copy code
[ { _id: 101 }, { _id: 102 }, { _id: 103 } ]
.distinct("_id") ‚Üí Pick only the video IDs.
üëâ Result:

Copy code
[101, 102, 103]
video: { $in: [...] } ‚Üí Find all documents where the video field is in that list of IDs.

‚úÖ Simple meaning:
This code makes sure you are only selecting documents (like comments, likes, etc.) that belong to the videos of one channel.*/
